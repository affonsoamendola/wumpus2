-2 characters, the nameless hunter and the Mighty Wumpus Wizard (Older Brother of the original Wumpus)
-Multiple levels/floors (50 or so)
-High Resolution 256-color VGA graphics
-Puzzler, each level is an individual puzzle, without correlation between levels apart from general locations
-The Wumpus Wizard created all puzzles as traps protecting his lair.
-The hunter bought exactly the number of arrows as levels or has a magic arrow that returns to him after being shot

-Puzzles
--Each floor is a logic puzzle with only one or two solutions
--"     "    has a grid like structure, but can have different structures like walls and etc.
--The solution can be reached by firing one single arrow, 

-Traps 
-- Laser Turret (Really sensitive, can be destroyed by anything (arrow, other lasers, fire, cold), sh)
-- Mirrors (Not really traps, deflect lasers by 90 degrees, double sided, can be pushed, and rotated)
-- Bombs (If ignited, by lasers, or fire, explodes after a few seconds) (Dont know if I really want this in, not really trying to make a Dweep Clone)
-- Spiked Pits (Can be filled by pushing rocks and other things in them.)
-- Bottomless Pits (Can NOT be filled, but you can drop things in it to clear them from the game)
-- Sentries (Moving Bots, patrolling specified areas, heavilly armed, but their ammo ran out long ago by misfiring)
-- Pressure Plates, Buttons, Laser Receivers (Enable or disable certain traps)
-- Draw Bridges
-- Falling Rock Traps
-- Conveyor Belts
-- Colored Keys (Cant have a 90s inspired game without keycards right?)
-- Colored Doors (Consumes a Key, can fuck you up if you open in a different order then expected
-- I believe that is enough to start it up, should be easy to make 50 puzzles with these elements, Right?
